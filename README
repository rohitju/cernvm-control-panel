*** Compiling ***

The build system of CernVM Installer has been developed on the 
basis of CMakeQt project (http://github.com/rohityadav/cmakeqt, (C) Rohit Yadav 
<rohityadav89 _ at_ gmail.com>, 2009-11)

  mkdir build && cd build
  cmake .. && make
  
The binary will be created in <build-folder>/bin

*** Packaging ***

1. On Linux: 
  make package

  To force deb:
    cpack -G DEB

  To force rom:
    cpack -G RPM

2. On Mac: (gcc, g++, make, cmake, qt 4.6+ etc. must be installed...)
  cd contribs
  sh contribs-mac.sh
  This will by default create a Mac Bundle, cernvm-installer.app in build/bin

  To create a dmg image:
    Uncomment #dmg in /src/CMakeLists.txt, at the end of the file.
    and follow the build process, the dmg will be created in build/bin

3. To cross-compile and package on linux for windows:

  cd contribs
  sh contribs.sh
  mkdir win32 && cd win32
  cmake -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=cmake/toolchain-win32.cmake ..
  make
  make installer

  This will create an .exe installer in win32/bin
